From this article:
https://levelup.gitconnected.com/developing-a-full-app-using-the-vue-3-composition-api-4fd9431f2136

## Summary
I have explained some of the benefits of the new Composition API, but you can read more and keep upto date with any updates on the offical Vue docs page for Vue 3 https://v3.vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html
We have built an full app using the Vue 2 options API and converted it to use the Vue 3 composition API.

Remember all the code for this app is available on GitHub. The repo contains two branches, one with the app developed using the Options API and another branch with the Composition API https://github.com/simonjcarr/vue3_composition_api
